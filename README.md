# Kanan

A homemade Kanban Board software, made as a clone of Trello. I'm making this as a personal project. A Trello clone is great for me to make because I use Trello often, and as Richard Feynman said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand."

## Usage

Unlike Trello, this is __not__ an online service you can use. To run this, you must clone this repository, and run the .exe to start the server whenever you wish to use the software.

## Credits

Built by Gautam Khajuria, inspired by [Trello](https://www.trello.com). I used [Next.js](http://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](http://tailwindcss.com), and [React.js](http://reactjs.org).
