# Kanan

A homemade Kanban Board software, made as a clone of Trello. I'm making this as a personal project. A Trello clone is great for me to make because I use Trello often, and as Richard Feynman said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand."

Built by Gautam Khajuria, inspired by [Trello](https://www.trello.com). I used [Next.js](http://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](http://tailwindcss.com), and [React.js](http://reactjs.org).
